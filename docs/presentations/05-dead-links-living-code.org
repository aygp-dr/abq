#+TITLE: Dead Links and Living Code: Maintaining Research Software
#+AUTHOR: Jason Walsh
#+DATE: 2026
#+STARTUP: overview

* CFP Abstract (300 words)

The FIPA Contract Net Protocol specification, published in 1996, defined how
software agents negotiate task allocation. In 2026, fipa.org redirects to a
parked domain. The foundational document for multi-agent coordination is now
accessible only via Wikipedia and the Wayback Machine.

This talk uses a small project (ABQ, a filesystem-based message queue) to
explore research software maintenance:

- Dead links: fipa.org → parked domain, how we noticed and fixed it
- Living references: arXiv PDFs as Makefile targets that actually download
- Executable documentation: README.org with tangleable code blocks
- The 50-year-old pattern: Unix spools (=/var/spool/mail=) as design inspiration

We'll discuss why "debuggable with =cat= and =jq=" matters more than benchmarks,
why filesystem permissions are a feature not a bug, and why the simplest
solution often has the longest lifespan.

The meta-lesson: research software dies when its documentation dies. Links rot,
specs vanish, PDFs disappear. The code that survives is the code that carries
its own context.

- PyCon (research track)
- SciPy
- Academic departmental seminars
- Digital preservation conferences

* Talk Length

25-30 minutes

* Outline

** The Dead Link (3 min)
- FIPA Contract Net Protocol (1980/1996)
- fipa.org in 2026: parked domain
- How we found it: user clicked link, got ads
- The fix: Wikipedia as stable reference

** Link Rot in Research (5 min)
- Studies on academic link decay
- Half-life of URLs in papers
- DOIs help but don't solve everything
- The Wayback Machine as last resort

** Executable References (7 min)
*** Makefile Targets for Papers
#+begin_src makefile
RESEARCH_DIR := data/resources/research

$(RESEARCH_DIR)/2505.02279.pdf:
    @mkdir -p $(RESEARCH_DIR)
    curl -L -o $@ https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02279.pdf

research-papers: $(RESEARCH_DIR)/2505.02279.pdf ...
#+end_src

*** Why This Matters
- =make research-papers= actually works
- Dependencies are explicit
- CI can verify links still resolve

** README as Living Document (5 min)
- Org-mode with tangleable code blocks
- Examples that run, not just display
- The protocol spec IS the code
- Badges that reflect actual CI state

** The 50-Year Pattern (5 min)
- Unix spools: =/var/spool/mail=, =/var/spool/lpd=
- Maildir format (1strstrstrstrstr)
- Why filesystem queues outlive message brokers
- "Debuggable with =ls=" as design principle

** Lessons for Research Software (3 min)
- Carry your context (don't just link to it)
- Executable > descriptive
- Simple outlives clever
- Permissions are features

* Key Examples

** Example: The Rot
#+begin_example
# In README, January 2025:
[[http://www.fipa.org/specs/fipa00029/SC00029H.html][FIPA Contract Net]]

# What users see in 2026:
"This domain is parked. Buy this domain!"
#+end_example

** Example: The Fix
#+begin_example
# Updated reference:
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_Net_Protocol][FIPA Contract Net]]

# Wikipedia isn't perfect, but it's maintained
#+end_example

** Example: Self-Documenting Design
#+begin_src text
~/.abq/
├── channels/
│   ├── my-agent/
│   │   ├── requests/      ← ls this to see pending
│   │   ├── processing/    ← ls this to see in-flight
│   │   └── responses/     ← ls this to see replies
#+end_src

The directory structure IS the documentation.

* Bio Blurb

Jason Walsh builds software that references papers from the 1980s and worries
about whether those references will still work in the 2030s.
