* Common Threads

All talks share these themes:

- *Process over product*: How we built it, not what it does
- *Real examples*: Actual commits, merge conflicts, CI failures
- *Lessons learned*: What went wrong and why
- *No hype*: Honest reflection, not marketing

* Status

* Notes

- Talks 1 & 2 could be combined into a longer session
- Talk 4 works well as a lightning talk (10 min version)
- Talk 5 fits academic/research venues better than industry
