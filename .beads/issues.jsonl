Shows full message lifecycle: sender → requests/ → processing/ → agent handler → responses/ + archive/.\n\n2. **abq.el** — New Emacs Lisp package with: abq-dot-export, abq-org-babel-setup, abq-render-state-machine, abq-tangle-and-render, font-lock for ABQ message types/directory names, abq-mode minor mode, auto-activates on ABQ org files.\n\n3. **Bidirectional tangle/detangle** — :comments link on dot block enables org-babel-detangle. Tangle maps dot→c-mode via org-src-lang-modes for // comment syntax. Makefile has tangle, detangle, dot-render, dot-tangle targets with workflow docs. Generated files (docs/*.dot, *.png, *.svg) added to .gitignore. Pre-commit hook warns if generated files staged without abq-spec.org change.\n\n4. **REMOTE_HOST .env config** — Replaced hardcoded hydrabos with -include .env and .env.template. Non-phony `gmake .env` target copies template. Sync targets guard on REMOTE_HOST being set.\n\n5. **Security neutralization** — All hostnames (hydra, nexus, hydrabos, nexusbos), Tailscale references, specific OS patch levels, and repo paths replaced with generic placeholders (host-a, host-b, $REMOTE_HOST) across MULTI_HOST.org, TEST_PLAN.org, ADR 001, and cli.py.
